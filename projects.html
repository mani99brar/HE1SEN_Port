                        I built a Crowdfunding DApp using Tailwind for styling, Solidity for smart contract development, React for the front-end, and Web3 for interacting with the test blockchain. The goal of the project was to provide a decentralized platform where individuals or organizations could raise funds for their projects or ideas. The platform was built on the Ethereum network, ensuring security and transparency of transactions. Users could easily create a crowdfunding campaign, set a funding goal, and receive contributions directly to their Ethereum wallet. The platform leveraged smart contracts to automatically distribute funds to the project creator when the funding goal was reached.

By utilizing React, I was able to create a smooth and interactive user interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Solidity was used to build smart contracts that govern the game logic, making it secure and decentralized. Finally, Web3 was utilized to connect the game to the blockchain, providing a seamless and trustless experience for players.
